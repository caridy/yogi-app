yogi-app (experimental)
-----------------------

Yogi sub commands for YUI Applications. This module extends yogi (yōgē)
commandline interface to aid in the development of YUI Applications.

Applications are more complex than libraries when it comes to organize
the code, specially because the use of many different pieces created by
different pieces. This makes really difficult to generate metadata for
YUI loader or simple generate production code thru a build process.

Yogi App is set to solve most of this problems by relaxing some of the
strict rules used to build YUI and Gallery, making easier to re-use yogi
features in a freestyle. This includes a more relaxed folder structure
and support for YUI modules as source instead of providing the formal
module structure based on `build.json` definition.
